                <h2>Brazilian footballer </h2>
                <p><b>Pelé</b> , byname of Edson Arantes do Nascimento, (born October 23, 1940, Três Corações, Brazil—died
                    December 29, 2022, São Paolo, Brazil), Brazilian football (soccer) player, in his time probably the
                    most famous and possibly the best-paid athlete in the world. He was part of the Brazilian national
                    teams that won three World Cup championships (1958, 1962, and 1970).Pelé made his international
                    debut in 1957 at age 16 and the following year played his first game in the World Cup finals in
                    Sweden. The Brazilian manager was initially hesitant to play his young star. When Pelé finally
                    reached the field, he had an immediate impact, rattling the post with one shot and collecting an
                    assist.</p>
